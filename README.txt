# Bookmark Cleaner â€” Phase II Build (v0.9)

A JavaScript-based Bookmark Cleaner tool designed to parse, scan, and analyze exported bookmark files for dead links.

This version parses a standard browser-exported bookmarks HTML file, scans each URL using fetch requests, and outputs the link status directly into the browser.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- âœ… Upload browser-exported `.html` bookmark file
- âœ… Automatically parses and extracts all bookmark URLs
- âœ… Scans each link asynchronously
- âœ… Reports:
  - "Possibly Alive (No CORS)" â€” Browser was unable to verify due to cross-origin restrictions
  - "Dead" â€” Site unreachable
- âœ… Clean user interface
- âœ… Fully client-side â€” no server or external processing required

---

## ðŸ”¬ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Vanilla JavaScript (async / await)
- FileReader API
- DOMParser API
- Fetch API

---

## ðŸš© Current Limitations

- Browser CORS policy blocks full HTTP status detection on many external domains (displayed as "Possibly Alive (No CORS)")
- No automatic deletion or export yet (coming in v1 Enterprise build)
- Large bookmark files may trigger antivirus software due to rapid outbound URL requests (batching logic coming soon)

---

## ðŸ’¡ Roadmap (Planned in Enterprise Build v1)

- âœ… Batch scanning for better performance and safety
- âœ… Auto-delete dead and No-CORS links
- âœ… Export cleaned bookmarks as new HTML file
- âœ… Error logging & reporting
- âœ… Production-grade deployment structure

## ðŸ”’ Data Privacy

This tool runs fully in your browser.  
No data is sent to any server.  
Your bookmark file remains entirely local.
